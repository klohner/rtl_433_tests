# Professional Wireless Pool Thermometer WT0122

This is my second unit. The first one I bought decoded as "Nexus Temperature & Humidity Sensor" 
but this one is not recognized.

I started to generate the gfiles when the unit was outside and it was +1C
I took the unit inside and the temperature went up to +15C in the last
gfile.
