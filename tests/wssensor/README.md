Distance coding: Pulse length 224 us  
Short distance: 1032 us, long distance: 1992 us, packet distance: 4016 us

24-bit data packet format, repeated 23 times  
  TTTTTTTT TTTTBSCC IIIIIIII  

  T = signed temperature * 10 in Celsius  
  B = battery status (0 = low, 1 = OK)  
  S = startup (0 = normal operation, 1 = battery inserted or TX button pressed)  
  C = channel (0-2)  
  I = sensor ID  

## Sample data:
```
[01] {24} ff f8 8a  : 11111111 11111000 10001010

Sensor ID	= 138 = 0x8a
Bitstream HEX	= ff f8 8a
Battery OK	= 1
Startup		= 0
Channel		= 1
temp		= -1 = 0xffffffff
TemperatureC	= -0.1
```
