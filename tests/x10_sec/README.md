# X10 Security Sensor Devices

These signals were captured from an X10 DS10A door/window sensor
equipped with a reed switch and magnet for X10 security systems.

American sensors use 310 MHz (tuned to 310.558 MHz in this case).

These signals were generated by pressing the 'TEST' button on the
DS10A which causes it to send a 'CLOSE' signal followed by an 'OPEN'
signal, as if a door/window was closed then opened.

The DS10A seems to send each signal five (5) times to ensure it is
received.  Hence, decoding this recording yields five (5) CLOSE
messages followed by five (5) OPEN messages.

    Test Recording File: x10_sec-DS10A-closex5-openx5.250k.cu8
    Test DS10A Device ID: 0xf58e
    DOOR/WINDOW CLOSED Code: 0x84
    DOOR/WINDOW OPEN Code: 0x04

## Would you like to know more?

Information on the X10 security protocol is available, although it
is not as well-known as the home automation variant.  X10 security
signals are decoded, for example, by the WGL Designs W800 RF receiver.
