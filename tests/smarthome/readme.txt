This is a remote control for a window shutter. It has three buttons, UP, DOWN and middle (STOP).
I've recorded the 
- UP button in g004_433.92M_250k.cu8 
- DOWN button in g003_433.92M_250k.cu8 
- STOP button in g002_433.92M_250k.cu8

I also recorded another device of the same kind that operates a different shutter
- UP up_other_g002_433.92M_250k.cu8 
- DOWN dn_other_g005_433.92M_250k.cu8
- STOP stop_other_g003_433.92M_250k.cu8 

The device says the model number is DC305A, but there is a variety of compatible devices
