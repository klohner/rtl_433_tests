There are two sensors uploaded (ID 3B86C945 and 3B8273B0). 

G001 through g003 are 3B86C945. g001 is a baseline sensor reading @ ambient. g002 shows a small cooling at the same pressure, g003 is me blowing into the pressure port and triggering the sensor with TPMS tool (Ill advised, these do not taste good) which shows small pressure and temperature increase.

g004 is a baseline @ ambient of 3B8273B0 to help show ID bits. 

Data (Battery Status, Temperature and Pressure) is reported from an Autel TPMS 501 Tool. These signals are in direct response to the trigger sent by the tool. The tool saves recent tests so I was able to change unit display. There's probably a conversion factor built into the tool's output so there may not align exactly with bit output.
